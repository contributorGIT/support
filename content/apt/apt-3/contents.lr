Yes, `deb.torproject.org` is also served through via an Onion Service: http://sdscoq7snqtznauu.onion/

> **Note:** The symbol # refers to be running the code as root. That means you should have access to a user account with system administration privileges, e.g your user should be in the sudo group.

To use Apt over Tor, the apt transport needs to be installed:

   ```
   # apt install apt-transport-tor
   ```

Then replace the address in the lines added before with, for example:

   ```
   # For the stable version.
   deb tor://sdscoq7snqtznauu.onion/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main

   # For the unstable version.
   deb tor://sdscoq7snqtznauu.onion/torproject.org tor-nightly-master-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with your Operating System codename. Run `lsb_release -c` or `cat /etc/debian_version` to discover.

Now refresh your sources and try if it's still possible to install tor:

   ```
   # apt update
   # apt install tor
   ```
