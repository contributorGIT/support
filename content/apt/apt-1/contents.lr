description:

The Tor Project maintains its own [Debian package repository](https://deb.torproject.org). Since Debian provides the LTS version of Tor that this might not always give you the latest stable Tor version, it's recommended to install `tor` from our repository.

Here's how you can enable Tor Package Repository in Debian based distributions:

> **Note:** The symbol # refers to be running the code as root. That means you should have access to a user account with system administration privileges, e.g your user should be in the sudo group.

#### 1. Install `apt-transport-https`

To enable all package managers using the libapt-pkg library to access metadata and packages available in sources accessible over https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). 

   ```
   # apt install apt-transport-https
   ```

#### 2. Add the following entries to `/etc/apt/sources.list` or a new file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` 

   ```
   deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

If you want to try experimental packages:

   ```
   deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-0.3.4.x-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-0.3.4.x-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Or nightly builds:

   ```
   deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-master-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-master-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   ```

Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with your Operating System codename. Run `lsb_release -c` or `cat /etc/debian_version` to discover.

#### 3. Then add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the following commands at your command prompt

   ```
   # wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --import
   # gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | apt-key add -
   ```

#### 4. Install tor and tor debian keyring

We provide a Debian package to help you keep our signing key current. It is recommended you use it. Install it with the following commands:

   ```
   # apt update
   # apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
   ```
