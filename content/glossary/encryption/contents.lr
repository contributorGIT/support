term: encryption

definition:

The process of taking a piece of data and scrambling it into a secret code that can only be read by the intended recipient. [Tor](../tor-tor-network-core-tor) uses three layers of encryption in the Tor [circuit](../circuit); each [relay](../relay) decrypts one layer before passing the request on to the next relay.
