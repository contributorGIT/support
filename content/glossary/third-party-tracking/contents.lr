definition:

Most websites use numerous third-party services, including advertising and analytics trackers, which collect data about your [IP address](../ip-address), [web browser](../web-browser), [system](../operating-system-os) and your browsing behavior itself, all of which can link your activity across different sites.
[Tor Browser](../tor-browser) prevents a lot of this activity from happening.
