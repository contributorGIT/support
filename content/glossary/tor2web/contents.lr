term: Tor2Web
---
definition:

Tor2web is a project to let users access [onion services](../onion-services) without using the [Tor Browser](../tor-browser).
NOTE: This is not as safe as connecting to the [onion services](../onion-services) via Tor Browser, and will remove all [Tor](../tor-tor-network-core-tor)-related protections the [client](../client) would otherwise have.
