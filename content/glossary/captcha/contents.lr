term: CAPTCHA

definition:

CAPTCHAs are a challenge-response test used in computing to determine whether the user is human or not.
[Tor](../tor-tor-network-core-tor) users are often served captchas because Tor [relays](../relay) make so many requests that sometimes websites have a hard time determining whether or not those requests are coming from humans or bots.
