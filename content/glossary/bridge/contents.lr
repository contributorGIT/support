term: bridge
---
definition:

Like ordinary Tor [relays](../relay), bridges are run by volunteers; unlike ordinary relays, however, they are not listed publicly, so an adversary cannot identify them easily.
[Pluggable transports](../pluggable-transports) are a type of bridge that helps disguise the fact that you are using Tor.
