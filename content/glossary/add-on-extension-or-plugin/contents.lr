term: add-on, extension, or plugin
---
definition:

Add-ons, extensions, and plugins are components that can be added to [web browsers](../web-browser) to give them new features.
Tor Browser comes with two add-ons installed: [NoScript](../noscript) and [HTTPS Everywhere](../https-everywhere).
You should not install any additional add-ons on Tor Browser because that can compromise some of its privacy features.
