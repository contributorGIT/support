description:
We run an anomaly-based censorship-detection system that looks at
estimated user numbers over a series of days and predicts the user number
in the next days.  If the actual number is higher or lower, this might
indicate a possible censorship event or release of censorship.  For more
details, see our [technical report](https://research.torproject.org/techreports/detector-2011-09-09.pdf).
